The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.  \n",

You can tell the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to words from the base model for speech recognition. The weight that is assigned to a custom model is referred to as its ***customization weight***. You specify the relative weight for a custom language model as a double between 0.0 to 1.0. By default, each custom language model has a weight of 0.3. The default weight yields the best performance in the general case. It allows both OOV words from the custom model and words from the base vocabulary to be recognized.\n",
